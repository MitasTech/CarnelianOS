DO NOT RUN THIS. --> IT'S STILL UNDER DEVELOPEMENT 

This is a script that combines ArchMitas(My modiefied version of ArchTitus by ChrisTitusTech), DTOS(Derek Taylor's aka DistroTube OS) and XmonadCustom(My modified version of Axarva's dotfiles-2.0)
It combines the best parts of all the scripts to provide the perfect setup, my setup. It can be KDE, Gnome, Xmonad, anything, and each option has my personal 
customization.
I call it, Carnelian OS. This is an Arch automated installation with selectable choices to do any combnations you want.

This repo is created independatly without any forks to eliminate chances of future deleted repositories by those gentlement which is going to result in a tragety for all of us developers who use those scripts.
Thank you Chris, Derek and Atharva for the awsome scripts!

This wouldn't be possible without you, hope you like it!

This is a work in progress but the final version will be as it's stated above.
